# UI/UX Guidelines

## Form Validation
- All required fields must be marked with an asterisk (*) or implied by context.
- **Error Messages**:
    - Must be displayed in **red** text (#FF0000).
    - Should appear immediately below the invalid field.
    - Examples: "Name is required", "Invalid email address".
- **Success Messages**:
    - Must be displayed in **green** text.
    - Example: "Discount applied successfully".

## Buttons
- **Primary Action (Pay Now)**:
    - Background color: Green (#28a745).
    - Text color: White.
    - Hover state: Darker green (#218838).
- **Secondary Action (Apply Discount)**:
    - Should be distinct but less prominent than Pay Now.

## Layout
- The checkout process should be a single page.
- Sections (Cart, Discount, Shipping, Payment) should be clearly separated by borders or spacing.
